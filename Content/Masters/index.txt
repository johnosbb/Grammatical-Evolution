chapter1 -------- Introduction to thesis
chapter2 -------- Overview of Grammatical Evolution, special case of constants
chapter3 -------- Metaheuristics, Introduction and general overview
chapter4 -------- Grammatical Evolution and Genetic Algorithms
chapter5 -------- GE to date performance and charachteristics, this chapter is redundant and should probably go
chapter6 -------- Inroduction to the studied problem set, why they were chosen, initial problems . more difficult problems
chapter7 -------- Details of the experiments , configurations used with summary results
	 
	 this chapter will follow the format of - 
	 what can you vary and what is its effects
	 why you chose the values chosen
	 final set up for each metaheuristic
	 The results of the trials 
	 In this format each metaheuristic could merit a chapter in itself.
chapter8 -------- discussion on aspects of the results , productive parents , Contribution of operators , performance of random search, neighbourhoods. If I follow the previous format then some of the more detailed discussions featured here would be consumed in the individual meta chapters. Something we could do here is contrast the relative results.
chapter9 -------- improving GE through primimng, other short commings
chapter10 -------- Further research
chapter11 -------- Conclusions
